# **metrics**

In order to monitor and improve ExpandoDB's performance, we need to collect runtime performance metrics. 
Why collect metrics? **Coda Hale** explains it beatifully in this [presentation](https://codahale.com/codeconf-2011-04-09-metrics-metrics-everywhere.pdf). 

ExpandoDB uses the **[Metrics.NET](https://github.com/Recognos/Metrics.NET)** library to provide the following metrics.

- Request execution times for each REST endpoint
- Error rates
- Number of active requests
- Sizes (in bytes) of POST and PUT requests
- Process metrics such as CPU and memory usage, GC heap sizes, etc.  
- The following screenshot shows some of these metrics in action. **To access the metrics dashboard, go to http://localhost:9000/metrics**.
