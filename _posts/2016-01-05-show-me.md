### **... insert new Content?**
- Using your favorite HTTP command line tool (e.g. [curl](https://curl.haxx.se)), library (e.g. [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/)), or Chrome app 
  (e.g. [PostMan](http://www.getpostman.com)), POST a JSON content to the `/db/{collection}` endpoint. The target Content Collection will be auto-created if it doesn't exist yet.

  ![RestSharp Insert New](img/restsharp-insert-new.png)
  ![Postman Insert New](img/postman-insert-new.png)
- ExpandoDB will return a response like so:

### **... search for Content?**
- Let's go back to our reuters Content Collection. For search, we only need to send GET requests, so we can simply use Chrome (with JSONView).
- Say we want to search for the top 10 news articles with **petroleum** in the **title**, sorted by the **date** in descending order; 
  plus we only want to see the **title**, **date**, and **text** fields.

- Now let's search for the top 10 news articles that mention **OPEC**, **petroleum**, and **price** in any part of the article.
  We want to sort the matching articles by **date** in descending order. We want to see the **title**, and **date** fields. We also 
  want to see the **_highlight** field, which displays the best text fragment from the Content containing the search term(s); 
  the search terms are enclosed in HTML markup that will be rendered as higlights in a web browser.

- Now let's search for news articles published within the date range 1987-02-01 and 1987-02-28. 
- Finally let's search for news articles with no title. ExpandoDB uses a special token to denote missing (i.e. null) values: \_null\_. 
- We can also do wildcard searches, proximity searches, regular expression searches, etc. See [this article](http://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html)
  to learn more about what's supported.
