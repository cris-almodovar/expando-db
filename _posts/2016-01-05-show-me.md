# **how do I ...**

### **... insert new Content?**
- Using your favorite HTTP command line tool (e.g. [curl](https://curl.haxx.se)), library (e.g. [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/)), or Chrome app 
  (e.g. [PostMan](http://www.getpostman.com)), POST a JSON content to the `/db/{collection}` endpoint. The target Content Collection will be auto-created 
  if it doesn't exist yet.
  ![curl Insert New](img/curl-insert-new.png)  
  ![RestSharp Insert New](img/restsharp-insert-new.png)
  ![Postman Insert New](img/postman-insert-new.png)
- ExpandoDB will return a response like so:
  ![Insert response](img/insert-response.png)

### **... search for Content?**
- Let's go back to our reuters Content Collection. For search, we only need to send GET requests, so we can simply use Chrome (with JSONView).
- Say we want to search for the **top 10** news articles with the word **petroleum** in the **title**, sorted by the **date** in **descending order**; 
  plus we only want to see the **title**, **date**, and **text** fields.
  ![Howto Search](img/howto-search-1.png)
- Now let's search for the **top 10** news articles that mention the words **OPEC**, **petroleum**, and **price** in **any part** of the article (tile, text).
  We want to sort the matching articles by **date** in **descending order**. We want to see the **title**, and **date** fields. We also 
  want to see the **_highlight** field, which displays a text fragment from the Content that contains the search term(s); 
  the matching search terms are enclosed in HTML tags that will render as higlights in a web browser. The **_highlight** field is typically used
  when the Content objects are large (e.g. extracted from whole PDF or MS-Word documents) and it's not practical to retrieve and display
  all Content fields in the search results UI.   
  ![Howto Search Highlight](img/howto-search-2.png)
- Now let's search for news articles with any word that starts with **petrol\*** in **any part** of the article; we only want articles published in February 1987 
  (i.e. **between 1987-02-01 and 1987-02-28**).
  ![Howto Search Date Range](img/howto-search-3.png)
- To allow for minor misspellings in the query terms, we can do a fuzzy search by appending **~** to the search term. For example, 
  let's search for news articles with **indonisea** (note the misspelling) in the **title**. Fuzzy search is based on the 
  [Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance). Note that the max edit distance
  supported is 2 (the default).
  ![Howto Search Fuzzy](img/howto-search-4.png) 
- Finally let's search for news articles with no title. ExpandoDB uses a special token to denote missing (i.e. null) values: **\_null\_**. 
  The token can be modified in the application config file.
  ![Howto Search Null](img/howto-search-5.png)
- See [this article](http://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html) to learn more about the query syntax.

### **...update existing Content?**
- Let's go back to the **books** Content Collection and update all the fields of a specific book - we simply add the word 'UPDATED'
  to the title, author, and description. We do this using the PUT API.
  ![Howto Update Replace](img/howto-update-1.png)
- Let's check if the book was updated.
  ![Howto Update Replace - Result](img/howto-update-2.png)
- Now let's make a few changes to our book. Let's add a new array field called **reviews**. In addition, let's update
  the **title** field and remove the word UPDATED from it. We do both of these modifications in one transaction using the PATCH API.
  To learn more about the syntax of the PATCH API, see the **JSON-Patch** standard defined in [**RFC6902**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902). 
  Note that ExpandoDB only supports the following PATCH operations: **add**, **remove**, and **replace**.
  ![Howto Update Patch](img/howto-update-3.png)
- Let's see if the book was updated.
  ![Howto Update Patch - Result](img/howto-update-4.png)

### **...delete existing Content?**
- Again using the **books** Content Collection, let's delete a specific book. We do this using the DELETE API, specifying 
  a Content ID as parameter.
  ![Howto Delete Content](img/howto-delete-1.png)
- If we try to retrieve the book, we will get a 404.
  ![Howto Delete Content - Result](img/howto-delete-2.png)

### **...drop an entire Content Collection?**
- Lets drop the entire **books** Content Collection. We do this using the DELETE API, specifying just the Collection name.
  ![Howto Drop Collection](img/howto-delete-3.png)
- If we try to view the **books** Content Collection, we will get a 404.
  ![Howto Drop Collection - Result](img/howto-delete-4.png)

### **...see what Content Collections are available in the Database, and what their fields are?** 
- Simply send a GET request to the **/db/_schemas** endpoint. 
  ![Howto Get Schema](img/howto-get-schema.png)
- You will notice that ExpandoDB creates additional fields:
  * **_id** is the unique identifier for the Content 
  * **_createdTimestamp** is the date/time (UTC) the Content was created
  * **_modifiedTimestamp** is the date/time (UTC) the Content was last modified 
  * **_full_text** is the full-text representation of the Content (i.e. concatenation of all the fields of the Content).

At this point, we can now work with the full Reuters-21578 dataset.
 
- Drop the **reuters** Collection.
- Go to the `Loader\reuters` directory and extract the contents of **reuters21578.tar.gz** to the same directory.
- Run `Loader.exe` to load the contents of all the files (this will take a few minutes to complete).
