### **... insert new Content?**
- Using your favorite HTTP command line tool (e.g. [curl](https://curl.haxx.se)), library (e.g. [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/)), or Chrome app 
  (e.g. [PostMan](http://www.getpostman.com)), POST a JSON content to the `/db/{collection}` endpoint. The target Content Collection will be auto-created if it doesn't exist yet.

  ![RestSharp Insert New](img/restsharp-insert-new.png)
  ![Postman Insert New](img/postman-insert-new.png)
- ExpandoDB will return a response like so:

### **... search for Content?**
- Let's go back to our reuters Content Collection. For search, we only need to send GET requests, so we can simply use Chrome (with JSONView).
- Say we want to search for the top 10 news articles with **petroleum** in the **title**, sorted by the **date** in descending order; 
  plus we only want to see the **title**, **date**, and **text** fields.
  ![Howto Search](img/howto-search-1.png)
- Now let's search for the top 10 news articles that mention **OPEC**, **petroleum**, and **price** in any part of the article.
  We want to sort the matching articles by **date** in descending order. We want to see the **title**, and **date** fields. We also 
  want to see the **_highlight** field, which displays a text fragment from the Content that contains the search term(s); 
  the matching search terms are enclosed in HTML tags that will render as higlights in a web browser.     
  ![Howto Search Highlight](img/howto-search-2.png)
- Now let's search for news articles with **petrol\*** in any part of the article, published in February 1987 
  (i.e. **between 1987-02-01 and 1987-02-28**).
  ![Howto Search Date Range](img/howto-search-3.png)
- To allow for minor misspellings in the query terms, we can do a fuzzy search by appending **~** to the search term. For example, 
  let's search for news articles with **indonisea** (note the misspelling) in the **title**. Fuzzy search is based on the 
  [Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance). Note that the max edit distance
  supported is 2 (the default).

- Finally let's search for news articles with no title. ExpandoDB uses a special token to denote missing (i.e. null) values: **\_null\_**.

- See [this article](http://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html) to learn more about the query syntax.

### **...update existing Content?**
- Let's go back to the **books** Content Collection and update all the fields of a specific book. We do this using the PUT API.
  ![Howto Update Replace](img/howto-update-1.png)
- Let's check if the book was updated.

### **...delete existing Content?**
- Again using the **books** Content Collection, let's delete a specific book. We do this using the DELETE API, specifying 
  a Content ID as parameter.
  ![Howto Delete Content](img/howto-delete-1.png)
- If we try to retrieve the book, we will get a 404.

### **...drop an entire Content Collection?**
- Lets drop the entire **books** Content Collection. We do this using the DELETE API, specifying just the Collection name.
  ![Howto Drop Collection](img/howto-delete-3.png)
- If we try to view the **books** Content Collection, we will get a 404.

### **...see what Content Collections are available in the Database, and what their fields are?** 
- Simply send a GET request to the **/db/_schemas** endpoint.
