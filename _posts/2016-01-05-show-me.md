### **... insert new Content?**
- Using your favorite HTTP command line tool (e.g. [curl](https://curl.haxx.se)), library (e.g. [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/)), or Chrome app 
  (e.g. [PostMan](http://www.getpostman.com)), POST a JSON content to the `/db/{collection}` endpoint. The target Content Collection will be auto-created if it doesn't exist yet.

  ![RestSharp Insert New](img/restsharp-insert-new.png)
  ![Postman Insert New](img/postman-insert-new.png)
- ExpandoDB will return a response like so:

### **... search for Content?**
- Let's go back to our reuters Content Collection. For search, we only need to send GET requests, so we can simply use Chrome (with JSONView).
- Say we want to search for the top 10 news articles with **petroleum** in the **title**, sorted by the **date** in descending order; 
  plus we only want to see the **title**, **date**, and **text** fields. This is how to do it:

- OK now let's search for the top 10 news articles that mention **OPEC**, **petroleum**, and **price** in any part of the article.
  We want the matching articles sorted by the **date** in descending order. We only want to see the **title**, and **date** fields; 
  plus we want the **_highlight** field, which is a text fragment from the full Content where the search term(s) can be found.
