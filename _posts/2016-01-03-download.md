# Up and running in under 5 minutes


- Download the latest version from the [**ExpandoDB github releases page**](https://github.com/cris-almodovar/expando-db/releases).
  * *ExpandoDB.Service.zip* - this is the main package.
  * (Optional) *Loader.zip* - this is an app that populates ExpandoDB with sample data (the Reuters-21578 dataset).
- **IMPORTANT** You need to **unblock** the zip files in Windows before unzipping them. How? just right click and 'Unblock', 
  as explained in [this article](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/unblock-file-windows-8).  
- Unzip **ExpandoDB.Service.zip** to a suitable directory, e.g. d:\ExpandoDB. Likewise, unzip **Loader.zip** to a suitable directory, e.g. d:\Loader.
- Open an **Admin command prompt** window and `cd` to the ExpandoDB directory. Type `ExpandoDB.Service.exe install` and press ENTER.
  This will install ExpandoDB as a Windows service.

  To start the ExpandoDB Windows service, on the same Admin command prompt, type `net start ExpandoDB.Service` and press ENTER. 
  The ExpandoDB Windows service will start, and the ExpandoDB REST service will start listening on port 9000.

Now that you've installed ExpandoDB, head over to [Usage](#usage) to get it running with your own stuff!
