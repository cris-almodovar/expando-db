# **up and running in 5 minutes**

- Download the latest version from the [**ExpandoDB github releases page**](https://github.com/cris-almodovar/expando-db/releases).
  * *ExpandoDB.Service.zip* - this contains the main ExpandoDB binaries.
  * (Optional) *Loader.zip* - this is an app that populates ExpandoDB with sample data (the Reuters-21578 dataset).

- **IMPORTANT** You need to **unblock** the zip files in Windows before unzipping them. How? Just right click and 'Unblock' 
  as explained in [this article](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/unblock-file-windows-8). 
{: .text-white}  
- Unzip *ExpandoDB.Service.zip* to a suitable directory, e.g. d:\ExpandoDB. 
  Likewise, unzip *Loader.zip* to a suitable directory, e.g. d:\Loader.
- Open an Admin command prompt window and `cd` to the ExpandoDB directory. 
- Enter the command `ExpandoDB.Service.exe install`. This will install ExpandoDB as a Windows service. 
  On the same command prompt, enter the command `net start ExpandoDB.Service`. The ExpandoDB service will start listening on **port 9000** 
  (you can change the port number in the application config file).

- If you also downloaded and unzipped *Loader.zip*, `cd` to the Loader directory, and run `Loader.exe`. 
  This will load a subset of the [Reuters-21578, Distribution 1.0](http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578) 
  dataset into the system. Reuters-21578 is a dataset containing Reuters newswire articles from the 1980's. (You can also load the full 
  dataset by extracting *reuters21578.tar.gz* first before running Loader.exe).

- Open a browser and go to this URL: `http://localhost:9000/db/reuters`. If you're using Chrome and you have an extension 
  for viewing JSON (such as JSONView), you should see something like the below screenshot. If you don't have a JSON viewer, you'll see the raw JSON.
