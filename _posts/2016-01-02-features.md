# **ok, so what is this?**

Well, as it says on the tin, ExpandoDB is a JSON document database. 

- It is meant to store any data that can be represented as JSON - this means text extracted from crawled html files, 
  log files, emails, PDF files, MS-Office files, etc., or data imported from other databases.
- More importantly, it is meant to enable **super-fast search** of the stored data. 
  ExpandoDB's search engine is powered by [**Lucene**](https://lucene.apache.org), the 
  de facto standard for search engines. Unlike other Lucene-based search engines, 
  ExpandoDB doesn't require you to create Lucene index schemas - it auto-generates 
  the schemas for you!
- It supports a full range of query operations: keyword search, range search, wildcard search, regex search, 
  proximity search, fuzzy search, etc. See [this article for an overview of Lucene query syntax](http://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html).  
- It highlights the part of the text that contains the search term(s). 
- It is easy to setup - you can download and install it in under 5 minutes! It's packaged as a self-contained microservice, 
  so it doesn't have any dependencies other than the **.NET runtime v4.5.1**.  
- It has an easy-to-use [REST API](#rest-api), and it comes bundled with a [Swagger](http://swagger.io) API spec and viewer.
- It's open-source, released under the [**Apache v2 license**](http://www.apache.org/licenses).

Sounds good? Why not [download](#download) and try it out!
